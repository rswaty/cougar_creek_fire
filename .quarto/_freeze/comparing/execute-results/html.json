To present these broad ecosystem trends more effectively, we combined classifications of Existing Vegetation Types (EVT) into broader categories. The Developed EVTs of high, medium, and low intensity, and Quarries-Strip Mines-Gravel Pits EVTs were combined into one \"Developed\" EVT. Exotic Herbaceous and Exotic Tree-shrub EVTs were combined into one \"Exotics\" EVT.\n\n-   Second, we compare **amounts of succession classes** (past and present) for the most prevalent ecosystems.\n\n## Summary\n\n* Conifers, by percentage, were mapped to have experienced the most change between past and present, with over half being mapped as other types (e.g., Hardwoods or Developed) in the Existing Vegetation Type dataset.\n* There are BpSs with substantial over/under representation of succession classes.  For example the Northern Hardwoods-Hemlock currently has no succession class D, and the Jack Pine-Black Spruce Forest-Pine Barrens shows an over-representation of succession class D. \n\n\n** Chord Diagram**\n\n*Note: number presented when hovering equals acres.*\n\n\n\n\n\n<iframe src=\"chord.html\" height=\"720\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" data-external=\".5\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n<br>\n\n## Succession classes for three most dominant BpSs\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](comparing_files/figure-html/scls chart-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n",
